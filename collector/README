Instructions for running the OpenLI lab traffic generator
=========================================================

The OpenLI lab environment allows you to upload pcaps into the lab to
experiment with, just like the pcaps that are provided with the
collector container image. This means you can practice configuring OpenLI
to intercept traffic from your own network using the lab containers.

Instructions for uploading a pcap file and replaying the traffic into
the lab collector are given below.

----

1. Upload a pcap containing the traffic that you want to replay
   into the running openli-collector container.

   You can do this by running `docker cp` on the container host, e.g.

       docker cp <yourpcap> openli-collector:/home/openli-coll/pcaps/

2. Add appropriate intercept configuration to the provisioner
   using the REST API. This could include:

    * SIP server details if your pcap contains VoIP traffic
    * RADIUS server details if your pcap contains RADIUS traffic
    * Adding an intercept (IP or VoIP)

   See lessons 11 - 16 of the OpenLI tutorial for more information if
   you are not sure how to do this.

3. If your pcap contains vendor-mirrored traffic (e.g. Jmirror), then
   you'll also need to add details about the mirroring to the OpenLI
   collector configuration in /etc/openli/collector-config.yaml on the
   collector container. Restart the collector service when you're done
   to apply the new configuration.

   See lesson 17 of the OpenLI tutorial for more details on this step.

4. You can now replay your traffic into the openli collector using tracereplay:

      tracereplay /home/openli-coll/pcaps/<yourpcap> ring:eth2

   To increase the replay speed, add a `-X <speed factor>` argument when you
   run tracereplay, e.g. `-X 2` will replay the pcap at double speed.
