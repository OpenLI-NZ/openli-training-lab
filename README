The OpenLI Training Lab
=======================

This is a set of docker containers that should be used in conjunction with
the OpenLI Tutorial (https://github.com/wanduow/openli/wiki/OpenLI-Tutorial)
to learn how to configure and perform lawful intercepts using the OpenLI
software.

Instructions
------------

Install Docker for Linux on your intended host machine:

 * https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
 * https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

Make sure your current user has permissions to start docker containers.

Run the ./setup.sh script to create the lab environment.

You will now have four containers running on your host:
 * openli-agency
 * openli-collector
 * openli-provisioner
 * openli-mediator

Log into to any one of these containers using the following command:

    docker exec -i -t <container name> /bin/bash

Stop a container using the following command (note that any local changes
on that container, e.g. configuration you have changed, will be lost):

    docker stop <container name>

Running ./setup.sh again will stop and re-create all of the OpenLI containers
(again, losing any local changes you had made).
